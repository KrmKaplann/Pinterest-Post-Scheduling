For instance, imagine you have **10 Pinterest accounts** and you need to plan content for each one. Manually managing this process through Pinterest would be quite time-consuming and complex. Instead, with this Excel-based program, you can manage and enhance your content more easily. Thanks to the flexibility of Excel, you can view all your social media content at a glance and quickly make adjustments when needed.

Another advantage of the program is the secure storage and easy management of social media content on your computer. This way, all the content you produce is stored in an organized manner and can be accessed quickly when needed.

Additionally, you can categorize your content by date, topic, and other criteria, allowing for more strategic social media planning.

In summary, this program significantly improves your processes for planning, managing, and optimizing your social media content. It provides great convenience for users with multiple accounts and is an indispensable tool for professional social media managers.

## How to Use the Program and What is the Standard Filing Style?

In the initial part, you need to open the folder of the social media site where you will be working. As shown in the image below, folders for major social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, and Twitter are located in this section.

At this step, since we plan to focus primarily on Pinterest, we directly enter the Pinterest folder. Within this folder, you will find all the tools and files you need to plan and manage content specifically for Pinterest.

Depending on needs and preferences, necessary revisions can be made to the codes. This flexibility allows you to effectively manage and optimize your content on both platforms.

This process helps you organize your social media content more efficiently and develop a harmonious sharing strategy on both platforms.

After entering the **Pinterest** **folder**, you'll see the P**interest accounts** for which you can plan posts. By managing and organizing the content within the folders of these Pinterest accounts, you can schedule video posts.

Within the **Pinterest folder**, there are subfolders for various Pinterest accounts. Each folder, as seen in the image below, represents a specific Pinterest account. These folders contain the Pinterest videos planned to be shared on the respective accounts. In each account folder, you can find, edit, and manage the content specific to that account, facilitating the sharing process.

In each account folder, you can find and manage Pinterest videos specific to that account. This structure allows you to organize the content of each account separately and track the sharing processes more systematically. As shown below, .mp4 format files have been uploaded to the folder for planning purposes. All the content located here can be shared.

As we approach the final stages, organising the Excel file is critical to developing an effective sharing strategy. Each Excel sheet represents an owned Pinterest account. This structure allows you to manage the content of all accounts from a centralised location.

The Excel planning file allows you to efficiently organise content descriptions, sharing dates and times. Sheets created specifically for each Pinterest account allow for detailed planning and organisation of the content of that account. Content descriptions In Excel sheets, you can add detailed descriptions for each post. These descriptions make your posts more informative and engaging. Post dates and times The Excel file allows you to schedule the date and time of each post. This feature helps you increase engagement and visibility by sharing your content at the most convenient times. Efficient editing Thanks to Excel's flexible structure, you can edit your content quickly and easily. When you want to make changes, you can revise your entire plan by simply updating the relevant cells.

When editing the Excel file, attention should be paid to the description section. The description section contains the title and description sections unlike other Excel Files. At this point, an extra keyword should be used to separate the description and title sections. Thanks to this keyword, the two sections are separated from each other and placed in the appropriate places.

The keyword "\Title" is used to make this distinction. The text before the section where this keyword is positioned refers to the title and after the title refers to the description section.
